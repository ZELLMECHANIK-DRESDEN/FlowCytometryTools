How to install?
----------------

FlowCytometryTools is a python package written in `python 2.7 <https://www.python.org/getit/>`__. FlowCytometryTools depends on a few scientific and data analysis libraries:  `matplotlib (>1.13.1) <https://matplotlib.org/>`__, `pandas (>0.12.0) <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>`__, `scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`__). 

#. The simplest way of installing all the required dependencies is by install either `canopy <https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/>`_ or `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_.

#. Optional: if you intend to use the FlowCytometryTools GUI for drawing gates you'll also need to install `wx-python <https://wiki.wxpython.org/How%20to%20install%20wxPython>`_.

#. Go to your command terminal and enter the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

    pip install flowcytometrytools

(Note: Please do not use `sudo` when installing with pip. Instead figure out
how to use virtual environments or get anaconda/canopy.)

That's it!
